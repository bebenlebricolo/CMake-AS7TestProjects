# CMakeAS7-TestProjects repository
This repository aims to provide some test projects for the development of the [CMakeAS7](https://github.com/bebenlebricolo/CMakeAS7) fork of CMake.
At the moment, very little projects are embedded and few configurations are tested.
But anyway, they all provide some basic information on how to set up a multi-platform project when it comes to AVR development.

## Registered projects
At the moment we have the following projects registered :
* [AVR8_C_fake_app](AVR8_C_fake_app/Readme.md) : small avr8 bit compatible C project only. Checking flags redirection and library targets registration

## Getting involved !
This repository can serve as an entry point for new contributor for [CMakeAS7](https://github.com/bebenlebricolo/CMakeAS7).
Anyone can contribute with its own test project (usually few lines of code) and as such the depicted projects may server as end-user testing scenarios.
This is a great tool to illustrate further needs, requirements and so on, so don't hesitate to share your bare-bones project.

## How to contribute ?
That step is quite straight forward :
1. Fork this repository
2. Create a new branch
3. Add your project using the existing project's models
4. Try out the CMakeAS7 binary on them
5. Submit a PR to this project once you consider your work is ready for integration.
6. Oh, and don't forget to update this [Readme.md](Readme.md) (please :smile:).

Easy, right ?
